### Task Assigned
* Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.
* The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticketclass, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

##### Steps Performed in the tasks are as follows:
1. Importing Libraries
2. Data Analysis and Preprocessing
    * Dealing with missing data
    * Graphical representation of data on different perspectives.
    * Feature encoding
    * Pearson's Correlation analysis
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
