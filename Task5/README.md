### Task Assigned
* Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
* Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
* Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,

and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or
undersampling for improving results.

##### Steps Performed in the tasks are as follows:
1. Importing Libraries
2. Data Analysis and Preprocessing
    * Dealing with missing data
    * Handling the Imbalanced data
    * Scaling
    * Pearson's Correlation analysis
3. Model Training and Evaluation using Logistic Regression
4. Model Training and Evaluation using RandomForestClassifier
